## Stochastic Cellular automata

We introduce a stochastic cellular automata model in order to simulate the 
dynamics of the stock market. The stock market is a dynamical system without 
defined behavior, in this work we consider a model to describe the fundamental 
features of a particular market. The S&P 500 index of the New York stock market, 
trhought of the implementation of fundamentals ideas about the Ising model , 
direct percolation and stochastic negotiation model
